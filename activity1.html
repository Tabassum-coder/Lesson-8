    <p>Apple trees are small to medium in size. In the spring they grow white flowers. The fleshy fruits are usually ready to
    be picked in autumn. Apples are red, yellow, or greenish and fairly round. They are about 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10
    centimeters) wide.
    
    A new apple tree can grow from an apple seed. However, it will not grow the same variety of apple as the tree that made
    the seed. Because of this, people normally grow apple trees using another method. They cut a twig or bud from the apple
    tree to be reproduced. They attach this twig or bud to a rootstock, or a young apple tree grown for its strong roots.
    The parts from the two trees soon grow together into one tree. This new tree will produce the same variety of apple as
    the one from which the twig or bud came.
